					<h6>Lela  Lebron, 14</h6>
					<div _col="1/3"><img src="http://placehold.it/100x100" alt=""></div>
					<div _col="2/3"><p>Lela Lebron, seems like any other kid at her new high school in Spokane, Washington. She listens to alternative music and wears gauges in her ears.  She rocks Final Fantasy way better than any guy when not developing her own games with the kick-ass heroines she longs to see.</p> 

					<p>But Lela isn’t like her new classmates at all. One, she’s a Dominican but she was born in the USA.  Two, her parents’ the Lebrons entered the country illegally, so now her dad Pedro’s locked up and her mom Yuri was deported.</p>

					<p>Three, Lela is cartokinetic. What she draws comes true. Sounds cool, right?  But being a superpower isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Especially when you descend from a long line of cartokinetics on a centuries-long mission to abolish the International Council on Estrangement (I.C.E.), a global organization intent on fostering civil wars to the benefit of its greedy founding families.</p>

					<h6>Kiara Desallines, 14</h6>
					<div _col="1/3"><img src="http://placehold.it/100x100" alt=""></div>
					<div _col="2/3"><p>It’s not just out of kindness that KiKi saves Lela from Josie’s taunting on the first day of school. Unbeknownst to Lela, KiKi has an agenda to protect her. The quick-witted Haitian American teen who’s obsessed with astrology is, like her parents Deidra and Samuel, the descendants of the Chameleons assigned to the Lebron family.</p></div>

					<h6>Angel Garza, 15</h6>
					<div _col="1/3"><img src="http://placehold.it/100x100" alt=""></div>
					<div _col="2/3"><p>Like most boys his age, he’s into basketball, football and gaming. He’s in the mechanics shop at school but dreams of designing cars rather than fixing them. As different as they are, Angel likes both Lela and Josie so he can’t decide between them. Little does the Mexican hottie know that he’s a mere human in the midst of a centuries-long and worldwide battle between good and evil.</p></div>

					<h6>Bharti Billamoria, 15</h6>
					<div _col="1/3"><img src="http://placehold.it/100x100" alt=""></div>
					<div _col="2/3"><p>Bharti is an everyday girl from an immigrant Indian (South Asian) family.  She wants to be a graphic designer, but her parents want her to be an Aerospace Engineer.  After all, it pays well, has benefits and Indian girls just shouldn’t be artists. She’s a straight ‘A’ student, but being pulled in two directions makes her feel as if she always has her foot in many worlds and often an “outsider,” especially in Spokane, Washington.</p></div>
